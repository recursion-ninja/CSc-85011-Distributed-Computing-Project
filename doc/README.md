Course project for CSc 85011 - Distributed Computing of Spring 2023

## Front-end Terminal User Interface (TUI)

This project contains a TUI for a user to connect to the Science Brokering Service gateway and submit jobs for processing.
The TUI allows for specifying job priority as well as a soft time requirement for completion.

### Front-end TUI installation

To install the TUI from source, run the following:

```
make install
```

Subsequently, the front-end TUI binary will be available at `./bin/science-broker-terminal` located from the project root.

### Back-end 

To run the the backend, execute the following commands: 

For the broker:
```
java -jar ./broker-backend.jar
```

For the domains:
```
java -jar ./domain-backend.jar
```

Both executables are available in the `./bin` folder. They can also be generated from the source code with maven:
```
cd broking-back-end/demo/
mvn clean install
```
```
cd domain-back-end/demo/
mvn clean install
```
The generated executables will be in `/broking-back-end/demo/target` and `domain-back-end/demo/target` folders.

The domain executable should be executed on three different servers. Once all three domains are up and running, send their IP address to the broker:

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://<broker-ip>:8080/api/domains' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "ip": "<domain-ip>",
    "availableDiskSpace": 12000
```

## Database
The in-memory database is accessible at `http://<broker or domain IP>:8080/h2/`. The credentials can be found in `broking-back-end/demo/src/main/resources/application.properties` and `domain-back-end/demo/src/main/resources/application.properties`.

## Folders

Three folders should be created where the domain executable is running:
```
mkdir uploads audios queue
```

## Automated jobs
In the domain server, create a cronjob:
```
crontab -e
```

And then add the following line to the config file to run `./script.sh` periodically:
```
* * * * * bash /<path-to-the-script>/script.sh
```
